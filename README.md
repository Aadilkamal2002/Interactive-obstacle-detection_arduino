The basics of the app is to check the distance in front of the circuit/robot, and lock the application when an obstacle is too close. By “lock” I mean that the behavior for the output (LEDs and LCD screen) will override the normal behavior. And to “unlock” the application, you’ll have to manually press on a button.
